## Contents

R scripts are organized into one directory per panel (panel 1, panel 2, and panel 3v3).

For each panel, there are separate scripts for each batch ('data 23' and 'data 29') and for both batches combined.

For panels 1 and 2, there are additional scripts for analysis of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells only.

Each R script contains code to pre-process data and generate CellCnn inputs, run CellCnn, analyze results, and save output files.
